Testkitchenscripts
==================

A collection of scripts to build vm's using testkitchen, hopefully resulting in a directory that is self-contained for the vm.

Blog post on how the scripts work

Roadmap
=======

Intial install of basic scripts to get basic toolchain

Configuration of basic scripts to tie them together as a "toolchain envorinment" using chef-metal/kitchen-metal

Build of multiple environments using the above "toolchain environment"

Lots more testing of installed components

Install of "enterprise applications" in totality, everything, all of it to run in a standalone environment

Other ideas?  Hmmm let's see where we get to with the above
